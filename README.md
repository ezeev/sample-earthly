## Phase 1 - Tests

- [ ] Set up Earthly to run `yarn test`
- [ ] Create a Github action `ci-earthly.yml` that runs the earthly command above for all Pull Requests
- [ ] Make a new Pull Request against `main` to demonstrate that Earthly is run successfully in Github Actions.

## Phase 2 - Container Creation

For simplicity, assume all docker images will be immediately pushed to production, and seen by millions of users. In other words, there are no staging environments.

- [ ] Ensure the existing Dockerfile can be built & run

```bash
docker build . -t my-earthly-example --build-arg ENVIRONMENT=production

docker run -it --rm \
 -p 3000:3000 \
 --env-file .env \
 my-earthly-example:latest
```

- [ ] Now update the Earthfile to build the image, instead of using the Dockerfile.
      Update the Earthfile to push the new image to the - [ ] Github Container Registry (Note: do not use the docker-hub registry). See https://docs.earthly.dev/docs/earthfile#save-image
- [ ] Test it by pushing the image to GHCR using the Earthly CLI. Donâ€™t forget you must first authenticate with the registry
      Update the Earthfile to prevent pushing images unless all tests pass. You will need to modify the tests to pass
- [ ] Determine when ci-earthly.yml should push production images to the registry, and update it accordingly.
